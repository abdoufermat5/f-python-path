Here is a summary of the `PEP 412—Key-Sharing Dictionary` optimization in a nutshell:

* **The `PEP 412—Key-Sharing Dictionary` optimization introduced in Python 3.3 significantly improves the memory efficiency of object-oriented programming.**

* **This optimization allows instances of a class to share a common hash table, stored with the class itself.**

* **As a result, each instance `__dict__` can store only its own attribute values as a simple array of pointers, significantly reducing the memory footprint of instance dictionaries.**

* **The `PEP 412` optimization is thread-safe for read-only access, but not for write access.**

* **If you need to modify the attributes of instances from multiple threads, you should use a locking mechanism to ensure thread safety.**
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    instance1 = MyClass(10, 20)
    instance2 = MyClass(30, 40)
    
    print(id(instance1.__dict__))
    print(id(instance2.__dict__))
```
This code creates two instances of the `MyClass` class, `instance1` and `instance2`, with different attribute values. Before Python 3.3, both `instance1.__dict__` and `instance2.__dict__` would have been separate dictionaries. However, with the PEP 412 optimization, both __dict__s would share the same hash table, which is stored with the MyClass class itself. This can significantly reduce the memory footprint of the instances.
