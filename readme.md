# Fluent Python Notes

## Description
This repository contains notes and code examples from the book [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008) by Luciano Ramalho.
It is a great book for learning Python and I highly recommend it.
This repository is my personal notes and code examples from the book so you may be upset if you are looking for a complete guide to the book.
